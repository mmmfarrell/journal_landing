\subsection{Platform}
The proposed estimation algorithm was implemented and flown in
hardware to further demonstrate the performance observed in the simulation
results. The multirotor used for experiments was built on a DJI 450 Flamewheel
frame. All computation was done onboard the UAV on an NVIDIA Jetson TX2 using
ROS. An ELP
USB Camera with a 2.1 $mm$ lens was mounted to the bottom of the UAV such that the
camera faced downward during flight.

A successive loop PID control scheme was used to close the loop around the
estimated states. Throughout the flight, the UAV was commanded to maintain a
constant altitude relative to the goal frame of 0.5 $m$ while attempting to
drive the $x$ and $y$ components of $\vect{p}_{g/b}^v$ to zero. The relative yaw
angle between the UAV and the goal frame was also controlled to zero.
Controller commands were sent from
the onboard computer to a CC3D Revolution 32bit F4 flight controller running
the ROSflight firmware~\cite{jackson2016rosflight}.
