\subsection{Platform}
The proposed estimation and control schemes were implemented and flown in
hardware to further demonstrate the performance observed in the simulation
results. The multirotor used for experiments was built on a DJI 450 Flamewheel
frame. All computation was done onboard the UAV on an NVIDIA Jetson TX2 using
ROS. An ELP
USB Camera with a 2.1mm Lens was mounted to the bottom of the UAV such that the
camera faced downward in the UAV's bodyframe. Controller commands were sent from
the onboard computer to the CC3D Revolution 32bit F4 flight controller running
the ROSflight firmware using the ROSflight ROS node~\cite{jackson2016rosflight}.
