\subsection{Landing Vehicle}
As flight tests were conducted in a small indoor environment, the landing
vehicle was scaled down in an attempt to better extend to outdoor scenarios. A
landing vehicle was assembled as pictured in~\figref{fig:landing_vehicle} with a
6.1 $cm$ ArUco tag serving as the fiducial landing marker.
During the experiments, the landing vehicle was manually driven around the
motion capture room, following the perimeter of the room and turning at each
wall.
