\subsection{Landing Target Vehicle}
As flight tests were conducted in a small indoor environment, the landing target
vehicle was scaled down in an attempt to better extend to outdoor scenarios. A
ground vehicle was assembled as pictured in~\figref{fig:landing_vehicle}
% with a
% 6.1 $cm$ ArUco tag serving as the fiducial landing marker.
% During the experiments, the landing vehicle was
and manually driven around the
room during the experiments.
