\subsection{Fiducial Marker}
We use an ArUco marker~\cite{romero2018speeded}, as pictured in the upper, right
of~\figref{fig:features_with_aruco}, for the fiducial landing marker
in our experiements.
When detected, a relative translation and
rotation from the camera to the marker can be estimated using the positions of
the corners of the marker in the camera image and the known size of the marker. 
The ArUco library~\cite{romero2018speeded} only detects the marker when the entire marker is contained
unobstructed in the camera image. Due to these
conditions, it is not uncommon that the marker may be undetected for significant
periods of time during a landing maneuver.
