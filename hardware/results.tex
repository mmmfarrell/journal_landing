\subsection{Experiment Results}
\MF{Working on getting good hardware results plots.}
During the flight experiments, the multirotor UAV was manually flown until the
fiducial landing marker was detected. At this point, the closed loop estimation
and control was given full control of the UAV. To demonstrate the ability of the
system to maintain good tracking of the landing vehicle even when the fiducial
marker is not detected for long periods of time, the fiducial marker detection
was turned off a few seconds after detection.

The results are shown in~\figref{fig:BLAH}. It can clearly be seen that from
t=..s to t=..s, the fiducial marker is not detected, but the estimates of the
relative position of the goal frame as well as its velocity, attitude and
angular velocity remain accurate and consistent. These accurate estimates allow
the UAV to continue to control relative to the landing vehicle, tracking closely
above the goal frame.
