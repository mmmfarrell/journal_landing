Small multirotor unmanned air vehicles (UAVs) have rapidly become popular platforms for
surveillance, delivery, search and rescue, and a variety of other applications.
The abilities of small, multirotor UAVs to agily operate in confined spaces and to
take off and land vertically give them a unique advantage over other robotic
platforms. For the majority of commercial use cases, these UAVs are required to operate
completely autonomously, as skilled pilots are often not feasible due to
limitations in sight of or communication with the UAV. Though many aspects of
multirotor UAV autonomy continue to be researched and developed, operation in
static environments has largely been solved. A variety of emerging use cases,
however, require the multirotor UAV to operate from a moving vehicle. These use
cases include martitime surveillance, where the UAV must take off and land from
a martitime vessel at sea, governmental surveillance, where the UAV must operate
from a truck, and package delivery, where the UAV operates from a large truck
carrying the packages to be delivered. The ability to operate reliably from a
moving vehicle is still a very active field of research.
